{"name":"Daily Tasks","tagline":"Make sure you fulfill all those little daily tasks","body":"# Presentation\r\n\r\n_Daily Tasks_ is a basic to-do list for those of you who need to perform each day a series of little tasks.\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n* **Simple execution:** just create a `tasks.properties` file along with your JAR to configure your application and tasks.\r\n* **Do not lose sight of your tasks!** The default behavior for the _Daily Tasks_ is to stay on top of your other windows.\r\n* **Choose the look that suits you better.** _Daily Tasks_ comes with a set of themes you can choose from.\r\n* **No installation required** (maybe not exactly true: Java is required for this application to run).\r\n\r\n# Want your own?\r\n\r\n## Download and compile\r\n\r\nThis project is built using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). There are no special profile nor goal, and you can obtain a fully functional executable JAR using the following command\r\n```sh\r\nmvn clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JAR file will then be in your `target` directory, and you should be able to execute it by double-clicking it.\r\n\r\nIf you run it just now however, you will only get an error message because the configuration file cannot be found.\r\n\r\n## Configure\r\n\r\nTo run properly, _Daily Tasks_ expects to find a `tasks.properties` file along with the JAR file (or at least available on the classpath.\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample properties file. It is straightfoward and will not be described further.\r\n```properties\r\n# === GENERAL BEHAVIOUR === #\r\n\r\n# Specify a locale\r\n# Use xx or xx_YY with xx being the ISO code for language and YY the ISO code for country.\r\n# Leave blank to use the system default.\r\n#locale=en\r\n#locale=en_US\r\n\r\n# true to display tasks on top of other windows\r\n# false otherwise\r\n#always.on.top=false\r\nalways.on.top=true\r\n\r\n# Choose a theme\r\ntheme=GRAY\r\n\r\n# === TASKS === #\r\n\r\n# change the separator if you need to use the default on in your tasks description\r\ntasks.separator=;\r\ntasks.todos=Task 1;Task 2;Task 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore information is available [on the wiki](https://github.com/cyChop/daily-tasks/wiki/Configuration-file:-tasks.properties).\r\n\r\n## Themes\r\n\r\nHere are the available themes. Some are vivid or even ugly, but one of the point of this application is to remain visible no matter what.\r\n\r\n* `LIGHT`\r\n* `GRAY`\r\n* `DARK`\r\n* `BLACK`\r\n* `BLUE`\r\n* `CYAN`\r\n* `GREEN`\r\n* `YELLOW`\r\n* `ORANGE`\r\n* `RED`\r\n* `PINK`\r\n* `MAGENTA`\r\n\r\n## Run automatically on each boot\r\n\r\nMany methods can be used, but here is the recommended one for Windows.\r\n\r\n1. Find a safe location on your hard disk where you can put your JAR and `tasks.properties` file.\r\n2. Create a shortcut to your JAR file (I called mine _Daily tasks_).\r\n3. Move the newly created shortcut to your _Startup_ directory. If you have trouble finding this directory, do the following:\r\n  * Click _Start_, then _All programs_.\r\n  * Locate and right click the _Startup_ folder, then click _Explore_.\r\n  * There you are, you just have to paste your shortcut, and _Daily Tasks_ should startup automatically on next boot.\r\n\r\nPlease remember you will have to Java (1.6+) installed on your machine for _Daily Tasks_ to run.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# For coders and interested\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [the issues](https://github.com/cyChop/daily-tasks/issues/milestones).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCode is under [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork, edit, enhance, share, ...
